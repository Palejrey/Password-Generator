# Password-Generator

## Description

I've always wanted to be able to create a password generator for personal use.
I built this project to simple solution to create unqiue randomly generated passwords.
This mini-project solves the issue of when somebody needs a new password but is unable to create a complex password.
Across the creation of this website I learned a tremendous amount regarding Java Script and how to use basic structures to create a functional and interactive website.
